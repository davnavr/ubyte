# Planned Features

Features further down the list are ones I think are more difficult or will take more time to implement.

- Comparison instructions
- Exception handling (`try`, `catch`, and `finally`)
- Inline `name`, signature (`type` and `method`), and `code` in text format
- Multiple class inheritance to allow for interfaces/mixins/traits? (still need to fix field lookup problem in runtime)
- Figure out generics (advantages of reification and erasure)
- Interactive runtime to help with debugging
- Transpilation to CIL bytecode and metadata
- Interpreter translating hot paths with [`System.Linq.Expressions.Expression`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.expressions.expression)
- Debug format
